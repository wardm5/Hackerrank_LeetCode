# LeetCode
Problems and solutions for LeetCode problems.

I grouped problems into major categories which align with data structures, algorithms, or type of problems (dynamic programming, thread, recursion, etc.). For each problem, I state the problem, give examples, provide my approach, and then the code. Finally, I also provide my time and space complexity. I usually only post solutions for which I get above 70% for runtime complexity (which is usually near optimal runtime).
